# TezResolution - Committing Resolutions on the Tezos Blockchain

TezResolution is a revolutionary decentralized application (dApp) built on the Tezos blockchain, empowering individuals to commit to their resolutions and achieve their goals with enhanced focus and motivation.

## Stay Committed, Stay Focused

We understand how challenging it can be to stick to your resolutions and accomplish your personal goals. That's why we've developed TezResolution, a unique solution that leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide you with the accountability and support you need.

We are developing a motivational application for new year resolution that implements a financial mechanism by requiring users to commit a certain amount of money for each resolution they set.

The purpose is to enhance motivation and commitment by creating a financial stake. Upon successful verification of resolution completion, users will receive their initial contribution back.
